# Synopsis Q3
## Pi Approximation

- I estimated the value of pi by summing the areas of many small rectangles below the curve.
- I parallelized the loop so each thread contributed a part of the total sum.
- I combined the partial results to get the final value of pi.
- I observed how threads cooperated to compute a shared numerical result efficiently.
